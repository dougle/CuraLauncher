# CuraLauncher

A launch script for Cura on linux, download, install and run the latest version of Cura always.

### Dependencies
A download agent will be required, e.g. curl, wget or axel, I recommend axel for it's parallel download capabilities.

### Install
Clone or download this repo to a directory and adjust the paths in the .desktop file.  
`.desktop` files are installed into `~/.local/share/applications/`.

First use will have a little delay while it downloads the Cura binary.
